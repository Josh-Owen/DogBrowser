# DogBrowser

Howdy! This is a simple and lightweight application which allows for users to scroll through a 
list of dog breeds and displays a gallery of user selected dog breeds once clicked. The application was developed 
using the MVVM development architectural pattern and the reactive paradigm making use of Kotlin 
Flows which I have in recent months opted to start using as opposed to RxJava. The application currently 
targets Android API version 21 and above and has high unit test coverage.

Technologies used for the task:

- Kotlin
- Dependency Injections (Hilt with Hilt modules)
- Navigation Components
- Coroutines & Kotlin Flows
- Retrofit with a Retrofit Mock Web Server
- Espresso, Junit, Barista & Turbine
- Picasso

And that is all folks! Thank you for stopping by.
